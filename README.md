# Garage-Bin

## Summary

This was our final assessment at the Turing School of Software and Design. We had 10 hours to create a full stack application with the linked [guidelines](https://gist.github.com/robbiejaeger/44d65ddb36419b7825708524e9b43df2).

A production version of the app can be found [here](https://cw-garage-bin.herokuapp.com/)

## Installation

In your terminal:
`git clone git@github.com:coleworsley/garage-bin.git`

`cd garage-bin`

`npm install`

`npm run build`

`npm start`

This will run the development server on localhost5000.


## Tests

In your terminal:

`npm run test`

This will run the mocha/chai testing suite. There is only a testing sweet for the backend, no frontend tests.
